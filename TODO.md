# ToDo

* Use clouds providers library to do the deployment 

# Future Work

* The library could predict the cost of the deployment and the price per execution (depending on the usage frequency - daily, weekly, monthly, cors)
* Create an Out systems UI for defining workflows for each provider, such as the AWS interface
