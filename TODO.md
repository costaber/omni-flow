# ToDo

* Add dependency injection to the project
* Organize packages by provider
* CAD presentation
* Add more tasks to the backlog
* Convert to a multi-module project:
  * deployment
  * app
  * auth (can be a possibility)
  * benchmark

# Future Work

* The library could predict the cost of the deployment and the price per execution (depending on the usage frequency - daily, weekly, monthly, cors)
* Create an Out systems UI for defining workflows for each provider, such as the AWS interface
