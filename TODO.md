# ToDo

- Add the `.body` to the Google variables coming from the result
- Fix bugs with aws deploy
- Maybe check the number of generated lines for each cloud provider 
- Do unit and integration tests
- Create a script to generate N workflows

# Future Work

* The library could predict the cost of the deployment and the price per execution (depending on the usage frequency -
  daily, weekly, monthly, cors)
* Create an Out systems UI for defining workflows for each provider, such as the AWS interface
